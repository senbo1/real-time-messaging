          Take this part of your letter seriously because it's likely one of
          your first genuine opportunities to make a personal, positive
          impression on a prospective employer. You want your words to invite
          them to keep reading and to convey exactly why you're the best choice
          for their open position. Review your language to ensure it's concise
          and informative. If you're applying to multiple positions, take great
          care to edit your letter so that the first paragraph is personal and
          relevant to the exact position you want.
